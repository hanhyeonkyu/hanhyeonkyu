## ***"Simplicity is the soul of efficiency" -- Austin Freeman***

👋 Hello, I'm Alex. I'm currently working as a software engineer at a Healthcare Company, focusing on creating and deploying NodeJS-based visualization services that analyze healthcare big data. I have previously developed robust apps (web, mobile, desktop) using Typescript, Golang, and Python.

I'm always curious, always practicing, always looking back, never giving up and growing steadily.

  * **Learning:** Continuously taking courses and exploring new technologies via Github and Producthunt.
  * **Actions:** Actively participating in Kaggle and other contests to master new skills.
  * **Continuity:** Persisting and delivering results, even when faced with new challenges.

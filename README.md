I originally majored in Electrical Engineering and was a PLC engineer. I have been studying coding since April 2018 and working hard since December 2018. Although my actual career is not long, i have only worked in startups and have performed intensive tasks, and i am ready to perform, research, and solve any task now.

These days, I enjoy looking at popular open sources on github, researching them, and developing them for use in my free time. I mainly design a database, develop a backend, express it on the frontend, and configure it in the cloud, and I am concentrating on making more meaningful services by analyzing data.

If you have an interesting open source or side project, please feel free to contact me.

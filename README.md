### Alex HHK

👋 Hello, I'm Alex HHK. I'm currently working as an software engineer at Healthcare Company. I'm working on creating a NodeJS-based Web site and deploying it for providing visualization services that analyze healthcare big data. I have previously developed apps (web, mobile, desktop) using Typescript, Golang, and Python.

I'm always curious, always practicing, always looking back, never giving up and growing steadily.
* Learning: Continue taking multiple courses or learn new technologies through Github and Producthunt.
* Actions: Participate in Kaggle and other contests to become familiar with my new skills.
* Continuity: Even when faced with difficulties, always perform without giving up.
